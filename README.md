# Understanding MyBatis Dynamic SQL: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

MyBatis is a powerful ORM framework that simplifies Java database interaction by mapping Java objects to SQL queries. One of its core features is **Dynamic SQL**, which gives developers the flexibility to build SQL statements dynamically based on conditions. This is particularly useful when writing complex SQL queries that need to adapt to various scenarios.

In this guide, we’ll explore MyBatis Dynamic SQL, why it’s useful, and how to implement it in real-world applications.

## Why Dynamic SQL?

In many applications, SQL queries vary based on user input, configuration, or state. For instance, you may need to select different columns, apply varying filters, or join tables depending on user roles.

Instead of writing multiple hardcoded SQL queries, Dynamic SQL allows you to generate SQL based on logic defined in your Java code. This helps you write flexible and reusable code, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

## Dynamic SQL Features

MyBatis provides several dynamic SQL constructs:

- `<if>`: Conditionally includes SQL fragments.
- `<choose>`, `<when>`, `<otherwise>`: Acts like an if-else block.
- `<where>`: Manages `AND/OR` clauses automatically.
- `<set>`: Dynamically builds `UPDATE` statements.
- `<foreach>`: Iterates over collections to build `IN` or `INSERT` clauses.
- `<trim>`: Builds more advanced dynamic SQL structures.

We will explore each of these with examples.

The following guides illustrate how to use some features concretely:
